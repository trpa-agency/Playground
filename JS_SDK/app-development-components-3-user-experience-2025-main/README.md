# 2025 Esri Developer Summit - App Development with Components Part 3: User Experience 

Join us for the third session in our three-part series on building applications with the ArcGIS Maps SDK for JavaScript. This session is focused on building the user experience in your web app with the SDK's components and Calcite Design System. Calcite provides a library of patterns, icons, and user-friendly, configurable web components that enable developers to easily build responsive, accessible web applications. We'll demonstrate how the components can be used together to build intuitive yet powerful experiences in your apps.
